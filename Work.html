Organization	: Tata Consultancy Services
Client			: ASML Netherlands B.V.
Work Location	: Veldhoven, Netherlands.
Domain			: High Tech
Role			: Senior Test Automation Engineer
Skills			: <b>Java Script, Cypress, Gatling, JIRA, ALM, Bamboo, Load Runner, JMeter</b>
Project Methodology	: Agile
Team size		: 20
<b>Application Technology:</b>
Java based web application build with Angular front-end.

<b>Scope of the application:</b>
Application generates the sequences to recover a broken machine or steps required to replace a component of a working machine as part of the maintenance activity. Data intense application where its engine considers all possible operations and create a best sequence to fix the machine error. It’s a challenging task to the application to create a sequence as it needs to be short and should allow parallelism for multiple operators to work in parallel. Application plays a major role in ASML machines recovery.

<b>My contribution, my achievements and results:</b>
I am accounted for complete quality assurance of the application. My responsibilities include gathering all the requirements from the JIRA stories and convert all possible functional flows to cucumber feature files. Creating a manual test suite for regression as a backup. Automating the cucumber files to step definitions in the cypress framework.
Testing the latest version of the application after every sprint. Executing the performance scripts after every sprint and sharing the reports to the team. Which helps them in performance optimization.
Executing all the regression test cases before every release to production release.

During this phase I self-taught so many new things, I was working on UFT and other HP tools earlier to this project but had adopted the tools like Cypress for functional testing, JMeter for service testing and Gatling for load testing. In order to accommodate the need of Continuous Integration and Continuous Development.
Since I am also taking care of the releasing process, I release the latest version to production via Bamboo after every stable product is development is done. I am also conducting regular key-user meetings and creating improvement stories in JIRA based on their inputs.
Application went live with no bug slippage to production. Estimated reach of the application in ASML factory is 1200 users and with a peak load of ~230 concurrent users.

Work Location	: Veldhoven, Netherlands.
Domain			: High Tech
Role			: Test Automation Engineer
Skills			: UFT, ALM, Load Runner, VB Script, Excel Macro.
Project Methodology	: Agile
Team size		: 16

<b>Application Technology:</b>
SAP windows standalone, SAP-Web and a Java based web application build with SAP-UI5 front-end.

<b>Scope of the application:</b>
Application was built as a frame within SAP-ME (Production Operator Dashboard), Which is used as a reference for an operator to execute the steps on the machine. SQR helps the operators by converting the steps to automatic, semi-automatic and manual steps. Based on the requirement of operator intervention. This will help the operator to save their time and effort.



<b>My contribution, my achievements and results:</b>
As an automation tester, my main responsibility was to recognise the necessary test cases and convert them to test scripts which can further be used for regression on ALM-UFT. During this time, I was leading and coordinating my team of 5 who were working from India, we together delivered the quality assurance of the application. We had to execute the test cases after every release and reporting the defects using ALM. Also creating the same bugs in JIRA.
I also did the performance test for the application and gave the report after every release. This helped the developers in fine tuning the application for larger userbase.
Application went live to factory and field of ASML where the scope of usage of this application is estimated to be around 20k user base.

Project title	: Shop Floor Control – Production Order Maintenance (SAP ME)
Organization	: Tata Consultancy Services
Client			: ASML Netherlands B.V.
Work Location	: Hyderabad, India.
Domain			: High Tech
Role			: Test Automation Engineer
Skills			: UFT, ALM.
Team size		: 10

<b>Application Technology:</b>
SAP Windows standalone, Java based web application build with SAP-Web.

<b>Scope of the application:</b>
SAP Application which deals with the routings and production orders. Routing is a sequence of steps that needs to be executed in order to complete the production order. Graphical Routing Editor is within SAP ME and used to edit the routing. Such created production order will be executed in the Production Operation Dashboard. This complete flow was within the scope of test.

<b>My contribution, my achievements and results:</b>
As an automation engineer, I had to recognise the test cases which were vulnerable to fail after every release and automate them using UFT. Also had to fix the scripts whenever there are changes in the objects of the application. Automating the GRE was a hurdle as it was made using mxGraph components of Java which was not compatible with the testing tool I was using. I had to create an algebraic expression to calculate the location of objects based on the screen resolution. That worked like a charm. I received an appreciation for this.

Project title	: Siemens Teamcenter (Product Lifecycle Management Tool)
Organization	: Tata Consultancy Services
Client			: ASML Netherlands B.V.
Work Location	: Hyderabad, India.
Domain			: High Tech
Role			: Test Automation Engineer
Skills			: UFT, ALM.
Team size		: 3

<b>Application Technology:</b>
Windows Application build using Java.

<b>Scope of the application:</b>
Teamcenter manages the product designs of the ASML machines and the documents related to the machines. It also acts as a main source of operations for fixing the machine in case of failure.

<b>My contribution, my achievements and results:</b>
It was quite a challenge to automate the test cases related to Teamcenter. As UFT is not completely compatible with the application. We had to use image recognition for automation. Automating the manual test cases had decreased efforts of test regression form 4 days to 8 hrs. This was a huge cost effective to the client. We received appreciation for this.

These transaction needs to be settled among both the involving banks by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as part of the government of India regulation. Application used by RBI is what my team involved in development.

<b>My contribution, my achievements and results:</b>
As a support engineer, I had to understand the application well. Then after having discussions with different core bankers I gather their issues with the existing application. Then communicate the requirements gathered to the developers. Also, I need to make sure the users understand the known issues and limitations of the application as the risk is too high when a mistake is made.
This bridged the gap between the developers and the users. Thus, we were able to achieve a very high customer satisfaction rating.

Project title	: Kofax Image Processing
Organization	: Tata Consultancy Services
Client			: Kaiser Permanente Healthcare, US.
Work Location	: Hyderabad, India.
Domain			: Healthcare
Role			: Test Engineer
Skills			: SQL,
Team size		: 6

<b>Application Technology:</b>
Windows Standalone, SQL.

<b>Scope of the application:</b>
Application gets the data from a Kofax machine, which scans the claim forms of the health insurance firm. Such scanned forms contain data which needs to be recognised by the application and to be placed in the database. This data will further be used in processing the claim of the insured.

<b>My contribution, my achievements and results:</b>
As a test engineer, me and my team had to go through the forms manually and cross verify the data which was placed in the database by our application. Most of the testing is involved with intense queries of the database and manual testing.
During this process I have recognized the scope of automation of our work and I have done a POC. Which involves in gathering all possible values for every field in the form filled in with different combinations and feeding them to the application constantly after every release. This has expedited our testing process. Although that was not a complete coverage of all the tests as there were few handwritten fields which were very hard to recognize by the application. Apparently, that reduced the manual effort but completely didn’t avoid the manual testing. My effort was recognized by my organization.
